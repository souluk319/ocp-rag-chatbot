# Service

In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or morePodsin your cluster.

A key aim of Services in Kubernetes is that you don't need to modify your existing
application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism.
You can run code in Pods, whether this is a code designed for a cloud-native world, or
an older app you've containerized. You use a Service to make that set of Pods available
on the network so that clients can interact with it.

If you use aDeploymentto run your app,
that Deployment can create and destroy Pods dynamically. From one moment to the next,
you don't know how many of those Pods are working and healthy; you might not even know
what those healthy Pods are named.
KubernetesPodsare created and destroyed
to match the desired state of your cluster. Pods are ephemeral resources (you should not
expect that an individual Pod is reliable and durable).

Each Pod gets its own IP address (Kubernetes expects network plugins to ensure this).
For a given Deployment in your cluster, the set of Pods running in one moment in
time could be different from the set of Pods running that application a moment later.

This leads to a problem: if some set of Pods (call them "backends") provides
functionality to other Pods (call them "frontends") inside your cluster,
how do the frontends find out and keep track of which IP address to connect
to, so that the frontend can use the backend part of the workload?

EnterServices.

## Services in Kubernetes

The Service API, part of Kubernetes, is an abstraction to help you expose groups of
Pods over a network. Each Service object defines a logical set of endpoints (usually
these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy about how to make those pods accessible.

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with
3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible—frontends do not care which backend
they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the
frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep
track of the set of backends themselves.

The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined
by aselectorthat you
define.
To learn about other ways to define Service endpoints,
seeServiceswithoutselectors.

If your workload speaks HTTP, you might choose to use anIngressto control how web traffic
reaches that workload.
Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as the entry point for your
cluster. An Ingress lets you consolidate your routing rules into a single resource, so
that you can expose multiple components of your workload, running separately in your
cluster, behind a single listener.

TheGatewayAPI for Kubernetes
provides extra capabilities beyond Ingress and Service. You can add Gateway to your cluster -
it is a family of extension APIs, implemented usingCustomResourceDefinitions-
and then use these to configure access to network services that are running in your cluster.

### Cloud-native service discovery

If you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application,
you can query theAPI serverfor matching EndpointSlices. Kubernetes updates the EndpointSlices for a Service
whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load
balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

Either way, your workload can use theseservice discoverymechanisms to find the target it wants to connect to.

## Defining a Service

A Service is anobject(the same way that a Pod or a ConfigMap is an object). You can create,
view or modify Service definitions using the Kubernetes API. Usually
you use a tool such askubectlto make those API calls for you.

For example, suppose you have a set of Pods that each listen on TCP port 9376
and are labelled asapp.kubernetes.io/name=MyApp. You can define a Service to
publish that TCP listener:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

Applying this manifest creates a new Service named "my-service" with the default
ClusterIPservice type. The Service
targets TCP port 9376 on any Pod with theapp.kubernetes.io/name: MyApplabel.

Kubernetes assigns this Service an IP address (thecluster IP),
that is used by the virtual IP address mechanism. For more details on that mechanism,
readVirtual IPs and Service Proxies.

The controller for that Service continuously scans for Pods that
match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of
EndpointSlices for the Service.

The name of a Service object must be a validRFC 1035 label name.

#### Note:

### Relaxed naming requirements for Service objects

TheRelaxedServiceNameValidationfeature gate allows Service object names to start with a digit. When this feature gate is enabled, Service object names must be validRFC 1123 label names.

### Port definitions

Port definitions in Pods have names, and you can reference these names in thetargetPortattribute of a Service. For example, we can bind thetargetPortof the Service to the Pod port in the following way:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: http-web-svc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
        name: http-web-svc
```

This works even if there is a mixture of Pods in the Service using a single
configured name, with the same network protocol available via different
port numbers. This offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving
your Services. For example, you can change the port numbers that Pods expose
in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.

The default protocol for Services isTCP; you can also
use any othersupported protocol.

Because many Services need to expose more than one port, Kubernetes supportsmultiple port definitionsfor a single Service.
Each port definition can have the sameprotocol, or a different one.

### Services without selectors

Services most commonly abstract access to Kubernetes Pods thanks to the selector,
but when used with a corresponding set ofEndpointSlicesobjects and without a selector, the Service can abstract other kinds of backends,
including ones that run outside the cluster.

For example:

- You want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your
test environment you use your own databases.
- You want to point your Service to a Service in a differentNamespaceor on another cluster.
- You are migrating a workload to Kubernetes. While evaluating the approach,
you run only a portion of your backends in Kubernetes.

In any of these scenarios you can define a Servicewithoutspecifying a
selector to match Pods. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

Because this Service has no selector, the corresponding EndpointSlice
objects are not created automatically. You can map the Service
to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an EndpointSlice
object manually. For example:

```
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name of the Service
                     # as a prefix for the name of the EndpointSlice
  labels:
    # You should set the "kubernetes.io/service-name" label.
    # Set its value to match the name of the Service
    kubernetes.io/service-name: my-service
addressType: IPv4
ports:
  - name: http # should match with the name of the service port defined above
    appProtocol: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 9376
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]"
  - addresses:
      - "[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]"
```

#### Custom EndpointSlices

When you create anEndpointSliceobject for a Service, you can
use any name for the EndpointSlice. Each EndpointSlice in a namespace must have a
unique name. You link an EndpointSlice to a Service by setting thekubernetes.io/service-namelabelon that EndpointSlice.

#### Note:

The endpoint IPsmust notbe: loopback ([REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]/8 for IPv4, ::1/128 for IPv6), or
link-local (169.254.0.0/16 and 224.0.0.0/24 for IPv4, fe80::/64 for IPv6).

The endpoint IP addresses cannot be the cluster IPs of other Kubernetes Services,
becausekube-proxydoesn't support virtual IPs
as a destination.

For an EndpointSlice that you create yourself, or in your own code,
you should also pick a value to use for the labelendpointslice.kubernetes.io/managed-by.
If you create your own controller code to manage EndpointSlices, consider using a
value similar to"my-domain.example/name-of-controller". If you are using a third
party tool, use the name of the tool in all-lowercase and change spaces and other
punctuation to dashes (-).
If people are directly using a tool such askubectlto manage EndpointSlices,
use a name that describes this manual management, such as"staff"or"cluster-admins". You should
avoid using the reserved value"controller", which identifies EndpointSlices
managed by Kubernetes' own control plane.

#### Accessing a Service without a selector

Accessing a Service without a selector works the same as if it had a selector.
In theexamplefor a Service without a selector,
traffic is routed to one of the two endpoints defined in
the EndpointSlice manifest: a TCP connection to [REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP] or [REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP], on port 9376.

#### Note:

AnExternalNameService is a special case of Service that does not have
selectors and uses DNS names instead. For more information, see theExternalNamesection.

### EndpointSlices

EndpointSlicesare objects that
represent a subset (aslice) of the backing network endpoints for a Service.

Your Kubernetes cluster tracks how many endpoints each EndpointSlice represents.
If there are so many endpoints for a Service that a threshold is reached, then
Kubernetes adds another empty EndpointSlice and stores new endpoint information
there.
By default, Kubernetes makes a new EndpointSlice once the existing EndpointSlices
all contain at least 100 endpoints. Kubernetes does not make the new EndpointSlice
until an extra endpoint needs to be added.

SeeEndpointSlicesfor more
information about this API.

### Endpoints (deprecated)

The EndpointSlice API is the evolution of the olderEndpointsAPI. The deprecated Endpoints API has several problems relative to
EndpointSlice:

- It does not support dual-stack clusters.
- It does not contain information needed to support newer features, such astrafficDistribution.
- It will truncate the list of endpoints if it is too long to fit in a single object.

Because of this, it is recommended that all clients use the
EndpointSlice API rather than Endpoints.

#### Over-capacity endpoints

Kubernetes limits the number of endpoints that can fit in a single Endpoints
object. When there are over 1000 backing endpoints for a Service, Kubernetes
truncates the data in the Endpoints object. Because a Service can be linked
with more than one EndpointSlice, the 1000 backing endpoint limit only
affects the legacy Endpoints API.

In that case, Kubernetes selects at most 1000 possible backend endpoints to store
into the Endpoints object, and sets anannotationon the Endpoints:endpoints.kubernetes.io/over-capacity: truncated.
The control plane also removes that annotation if the number of backend Pods drops below 1000.

Traffic is still sent to backends, but any load balancing mechanism that relies on the
legacy Endpoints API only sends traffic to at most 1000 of the available backing endpoints.

The same API limit means that you cannot manually update an Endpoints to have more than 1000 endpoints.

### Application protocol

TheappProtocolfield provides a way to specify an application protocol for
each Service port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer
richer behavior for protocols that they understand.
The value of this field is mirrored by the corresponding
Endpoints and EndpointSlice objects.

This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are one of:

- IANA standard service names.

IANA standard service names.

- Implementation-defined prefixed names such asmycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.

Implementation-defined prefixed names such asmycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.

- Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:

Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:

| Protocol | Description |
| --- | --- |
| kubernetes.io/h2c | HTTP/2 over cleartext as described inRFC 7540 |
| kubernetes.io/ws | WebSocket over cleartext as described inRFC 6455 |
| kubernetes.io/wss | WebSocket over TLS as described inRFC 6455 |

### Multi-port Services

For some Services, you need to expose more than one port.
Kubernetes lets you configure multiple port definitions on a Service object.
When using multiple ports for a Service, you must give all of your ports names
so that these are unambiguous.
For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
    - name: https
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 9377
```

#### Note:

As with Kubernetesnamesin general, names for ports
must only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and-. Port names must
also start and end with an alphanumeric character.

For example, the names123-abcandwebare valid, but123_abcand-webare not.

## Service type

For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a
Service onto an external IP address, one that's accessible from outside of your
cluster.

Kubernetes Service types allow you to specify what kind of Service you want.

The availabletypevalues and their behaviors are:

**ClusterIP**
  Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value
makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the
default that is used if you don't explicitly specify atypefor a Service.
You can expose the Service to the public internet using anIngressor aGateway.

**NodePort**
  Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (theNodePort).
To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address,
the same as if you had requested a Service oftype: ClusterIP.

**LoadBalancer**
  Exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. Kubernetes
does not directly offer a load balancing component; you must provide one, or
you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider.

**ExternalName**
  Maps the Service to the contents of theexternalNamefield (for example,
to the hostnameapi.foo.bar.example). The mapping configures your cluster's
DNS server to return aCNAMErecord with that external hostname value.
No proxying of any kind is set up.

Thetypefield in the Service API is designed as nested functionality - each level
adds to the previous. However there is an exception to this nested design. You can
define aLoadBalancerService bydisabling the load balancerNodePortallocation.

### type: ClusterIP

This default Service type assigns an IP address from a pool of IP addresses that
your cluster has reserved for that purpose.

Several of the other types for Service build on theClusterIPtype as a
foundation.

If you define a Service that has the.spec.clusterIPset to"None"then
Kubernetes does not assign an IP address. Seeheadless Servicesfor more information.

#### Choosing your own IP address

You can specify your own cluster IP address as part of aServicecreation
request. To do this, set the.spec.clusterIPfield. For example, if you
already have an existing DNS entry that you wish to reuse, or legacy systems
that are configured for a specific IP address and difficult to re-configure.

The IP address that you choose must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address from within theservice-cluster-ip-rangeCIDR range that is configured for the API server.
If you try to create a Service with an invalidclusterIPaddress value, the API
server will return a 422 HTTP status code to indicate that there's a problem.

Readavoiding collisionsto learn how Kubernetes helps reduce the risk and impact of two different Services
both trying to use the same IP address.

### type: NodePort

If you set thetypefield toNodePort, the Kubernetes control plane
allocates a port from a range specified by--service-node-port-rangeflag (default: 30000-32767).
Each node proxies that port (the same port number on every Node) into your Service.
Your Service reports the allocated port in its.spec.ports[*].nodePortfield.

Using a NodePort gives you the freedom to set up your own load balancing solution,
to configure environments that are not fully supported by Kubernetes, or even
to expose one or more nodes' IP addresses directly.

For a node port Service, Kubernetes additionally allocates a port (TCP, UDP or
SCTP to match the protocol of the Service). Every node in the cluster configures
itself to listen on that assigned port and to forward traffic to one of the ready
endpoints associated with that Service. You'll be able to contact thetype: NodePortService, from outside the cluster, by connecting to any node using the appropriate
protocol (for example: TCP), and the appropriate port (as assigned to that Service).

#### Choosing your own port

If you want a specific port number, you can specify a value in thenodePortfield. The control plane will either allocate you that port or report that
the API transaction failed.
This means that you need to take care of possible port collisions yourself.
You also have to use a valid port number, one that's inside the range configured
for NodePort use.

Here is an example manifest for a Service oftype: NodePortthat specifies
a NodePort value (30007, in this example):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      # By default and for convenience, the `targetPort` is set to
      # the same value as the `port` field.
      targetPort: 80
      # Optional field
      # By default and for convenience, the Kubernetes control plane
      # will allocate a port from a range (default: 30000-32767)
      nodePort: 30007
```

#### Reserve Nodeport ranges to avoid collisions

The policy for assigning ports to NodePort services applies to both the auto-assignment and
the manual assignment scenarios. When a user wants to create a NodePort service that
uses a specific port, the target port may conflict with another port that has already been assigned.

To avoid this problem, the port range for NodePort services is divided into two bands.
Dynamic port assignment uses the upper band by default, and it may use the lower band once the
upper band has been exhausted. Users can then allocate from the lower band with a lower risk of port collision.

When using the default NodePort range 30000-32767, the bands are partitioned as follows:

- Static band: 30000-30085
- Dynamic band: 30086-32767

SeeAvoid Collisions Assigning Ports to NodePort Servicesfor more details on how the static and dynamic bands are calculated.

#### Custom IP address configuration fortype: NodePortServices

You can set up nodes in your cluster to use a particular IP address for serving node port
services. You might want to do this if each node is connected to multiple networks (for example:
one network for application traffic, and another network for traffic between nodes and the
control plane).

If you want to specify particular IP address(es) to proxy the port, you can set the--nodeport-addressesflag for kube-proxy or the equivalentnodePortAddressesfield of thekube-proxy configuration fileto particular IP block(s).

This flag takes a comma-delimited list of IP blocks (e.g.[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]/8,192.0.2.0/25)
to specify IP address ranges that kube-proxy should consider as local to this node.

For example, if you start kube-proxy with the--nodeport-addresses=[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]/8flag,
kube-proxy only selects the loopback interface for NodePort Services.
The default for--nodeport-addressesis an empty list.
This means that kube-proxy should consider all available network interfaces for NodePort.
(That's also compatible with earlier Kubernetes releases.)

#### Note:

### type: LoadBalancer

On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting thetypefield toLoadBalancerprovisions a load balancer for your Service.
The actual creation of the load balancer happens asynchronously, and
information about the provisioned balancer is published in the Service's.status.loadBalancerfield.
For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
  clusterIP: [REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]
  type: LoadBalancer
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - ip: 192.0.2.127
```

Traffic from the external load balancer is directed at the backend Pods. The cloud
provider decides how it is load balanced.

To implement a Service oftype: LoadBalancer, Kubernetes typically starts off
by making the changes that are equivalent to you requesting a Service oftype: NodePort. The cloud-controller-manager component then configures the external
load balancer to forward traffic to that assigned node port.

You can configure a load balanced Service toomitassigning a node port, provided that the
cloud provider implementation supports this.

Some cloud providers allow you to specify theloadBalancerIP. In those cases, the load-balancer is created
with the user-specifiedloadBalancerIP. If theloadBalancerIPfield is not specified,
the load balancer is set up with an ephemeral IP address. If you specify aloadBalancerIPbut your cloud provider does not support the feature, theloadbalancerIPfield that you
set is ignored.

#### Note:

The.spec.loadBalancerIPfield for a Service was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.24.

This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.
It also cannot support dual-stack networking. This field may be removed in a future API version.

If you're integrating with a provider that supports specifying the load balancer IP address(es)
for a Service via a (provider specific) annotation, you should switch to doing that.

If you are writing code for a load balancer integration with Kubernetes, avoid using this field.
You can integrate withGatewayrather than Service, or you
can define your own (provider specific) annotations on the Service that specify the equivalent detail.

#### Node liveness impact on load balancer traffic

Load balancer health checks are critical to modern applications. They are used to
determine which server (virtual machine, or IP address) the load balancer should
dispatch traffic to. The Kubernetes APIs do not define how health checks have to be
implemented for Kubernetes managed load balancers, instead it's the cloud providers
(and the people implementing integration code) who decide on the behavior. Load
balancer health checks are extensively used within the context of supporting theexternalTrafficPolicyfield for Services.

#### Load balancers with mixed protocol types

By default, for LoadBalancer type of Services, when there is more than one port defined, all
ports must have the same protocol, and the protocol must be one which is supported
by the cloud provider.

The feature gateMixedProtocolLBService(enabled by default for the kube-apiserver as of v1.24) allows the use of
different protocols for LoadBalancer type of Services, when there is more than one port defined.

#### Note:

#### Disabling load balancer NodePort allocation

You can optionally disable node port allocation for a Service oftype: LoadBalancer, by setting
the fieldspec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePortstofalse. This should only be used for load balancer implementations
that route traffic directly to pods as opposed to using node ports. By default,spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePortsistrueand type LoadBalancer Services will continue to allocate node ports. Ifspec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePortsis set tofalseon an existing Service with allocated node ports, those node ports willnotbe de-allocated automatically.
You must explicitly remove thenodePortsentry in every Service port to de-allocate those node ports.

#### Specifying class of load balancer implementation

For a Service withtypeset toLoadBalancer, the.spec.loadBalancerClassfield
enables you to use a load balancer implementation other than the cloud provider default.

By default,.spec.loadBalancerClassis not set and aLoadBalancertype of Service uses the cloud provider's default load balancer implementation if the
cluster is configured with a cloud provider using the--cloud-providercomponent
flag.

If you specify.spec.loadBalancerClass, it is assumed that a load balancer
implementation that matches the specified class is watching for Services.
Any default load balancer implementation (for example, the one provided by
the cloud provider) will ignore Services that have this field set.spec.loadBalancerClasscan be set on a Service of typeLoadBalanceronly.
Once set, it cannot be changed.
The value ofspec.loadBalancerClassmust be a label-style identifier,
with an optional prefix such as "internal-vip" or "example.com/internal-vip".
Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.

#### Load balancer IP address mode

For a Service oftype: LoadBalancer, a controller can set.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ipMode.
The.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ipModespecifies how the load-balancer IP behaves.
It may be specified only when the.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ipfield is also specified.

There are two possible values for.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ipMode: "VIP" and "Proxy".
The default value is "VIP" meaning that traffic is delivered to the node
with the destination set to the load-balancer's IP and port.
There are two cases when setting this to "Proxy", depending on how the load-balancer
from the cloud provider delivers the traffics:

- If the traffic is delivered to the node then DNATed to the pod, the destination would be set to the node's IP and node port;
- If the traffic is delivered directly to the pod, the destination would be set to the pod's IP and port.

Service implementations may use this information to adjust traffic routing.

#### Internal load balancer

In a mixed environment it is sometimes necessary to route traffic from Services inside the same
(virtual) network address block.

In a split-horizon DNS environment you would need two Services to be able to route both external
and internal traffic to your endpoints.

To set an internal load balancer, add one of the following annotations to your Service
depending on the cloud service provider you're using:

Select one of the tabs.

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internal"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-ip-type: "private"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/openstack-internal-load-balancer: "true"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/cce-load-balancer-internal-vpc: "true"
```

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internal-subnetid: subnet-xxxxx
```

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-address-type: "intranet"
```

```
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-internal: true
```

### type: ExternalName

Services of type ExternalName map a Service to a DNS name, not to a typical selector such asmy-serviceorcassandra. You specify these Services with thespec.externalNameparameter.

This Service definition, for example, maps
themy-serviceService in theprodnamespace tomy.database.example.com:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: prod
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.database.example.com
```

#### Note:

A Service oftype: ExternalNameaccepts an IPv4 address string,
but treats that string as a DNS name comprised of digits,
not as an IP address (the internet does not however allow such names in DNS).
Services with external names that resemble IPv4
addresses are not resolved by DNS servers.

If you want to map a Service directly to a specific IP address, consider usingheadless Services.

When looking up the hostmy-service.prod.svc.cluster.local, the cluster DNS Service
returns aCNAMErecord with the valuemy.database.example.com. Accessingmy-serviceworks in the same way as other Services but with the crucial
difference that redirection happens at the DNS level rather than via proxying or
forwarding. Should you later decide to move your database into your cluster, you
can start its Pods, add appropriate selectors or endpoints, and change the
Service'stype.

#### Caution:

You may have trouble using ExternalName for some common protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS.
If you use ExternalName then the hostname used by clients inside your cluster is different from
the name that the ExternalName references.

For protocols that use hostnames this difference may lead to errors or unexpected responses.
HTTP requests will have aHost:header that the origin server does not recognize;
TLS servers will not be able to provide a certificate matching the hostname that the client connected to.

## Headless Services

Sometimes you don't need load-balancing and a single Service IP. In
this case, you can create what are termedheadless Services, by explicitly
specifying"None"for the cluster IP address (.spec.clusterIP).

You can use a headless Service to interface with other service discovery mechanisms,
without being tied to Kubernetes' implementation.

For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, kube-proxy does not handle
these Services, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the platform for them.

A headless Service allows a client to connect to whichever Pod it prefers, directly. Services that are headless don't
configure routes and packet forwarding usingvirtual IP addresses and proxies; instead, headless Services report the
endpoint IP addresses of the individual pods via internal DNS records, served through the cluster'sDNS service.
To define a headless Service, you make a Service with.spec.typeset to ClusterIP (which is also the default fortype),
and you additionally set.spec.clusterIPto None.

The string value None is a special case and is not the same as leaving the.spec.clusterIPfield unset.

How DNS is automatically configured depends on whether the Service has selectors defined:

### With selectors

For headless Services that define selectors, the endpoints controller creates
EndpointSlices in the Kubernetes API, and modifies the DNS configuration to return
A or AAAA records (IPv4 or IPv6 addresses) that point directly to the Pods backing the Service.

### Without selectors

For headless Services that do not define selectors, the control plane does
not create EndpointSlice objects. However, the DNS system looks for and configures
either:

- DNS CNAME records fortype: ExternalNameServices.
- DNS A / AAAA records for all IP addresses of the Service's ready endpoints,
for all Service types other thanExternalName.For IPv4 endpoints, the DNS system creates A records.For IPv6 endpoints, the DNS system creates AAAA records.
- For IPv4 endpoints, the DNS system creates A records.
- For IPv6 endpoints, the DNS system creates AAAA records.

When you define a headless Service without a selector, theportmust
match thetargetPort.

## Discovering services

For clients running inside your cluster, Kubernetes supports two primary modes of
finding a Service: environment variables and DNS.

### Environment variables

When a Pod is run on a Node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables
for each active Service. It adds{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOSTand{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORTvariables,
where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.

For example, the Serviceredis-primarywhich exposes TCP port 6379 and has been
allocated cluster IP address [REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP], produces the following environment
variables:

```
REDIS_PRIMARY_SERVICE_HOST=[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]
REDIS_PRIMARY_SERVICE_PORT=6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT=tcp://[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]:6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP=tcp://[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]:6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_PROTO=tcp
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=[REDACTED_PRIVATE_IP]
```

#### Note:

When you have a Pod that needs to access a Service, and you are using
the environment variable method to publish the port and cluster IP to the client
Pods, you must create the Servicebeforethe client Pods come into existence.
Otherwise, those client Pods won't have their environment variables populated.

If you only use DNS to discover the cluster IP for a Service, you don't need to
worry about this ordering issue.

Kubernetes also supports and provides variables that are compatible with Docker
Engine's "legacy container links" feature.
You can readmakeLinkVariablesto see how this is implemented in Kubernetes.

### DNS

You can (and almost always should) set up a DNS service for your Kubernetes
cluster using anadd-on.

A cluster-aware DNS server, such as CoreDNS, watches the Kubernetes API for new
Services and creates a set of DNS records for each one. If DNS has been enabled
throughout your cluster then all Pods should automatically be able to resolve
Services by their DNS name.

For example, if you have a Service calledmy-servicein a Kubernetes
namespacemy-ns, the control plane and the DNS Service acting together
create a DNS record formy-service.my-ns. Pods in themy-nsnamespace
should be able to find the service by doing a name lookup formy-service(my-service.my-nswould also work).

Pods in other namespaces must qualify the name asmy-service.my-ns. These names
will resolve to the cluster IP assigned for the Service.

Kubernetes also supports DNS SRV (Service) records for named ports. If themy-service.my-nsService has a port namedhttpwith the protocol set toTCP, you can do a DNS SRV query for_http._tcp.my-service.my-nsto discover
the port number forhttp, as well as the IP address.

The Kubernetes DNS server is the only way to accessExternalNameServices.
You can find more information aboutExternalNameresolution inDNS for Services and Pods.

## Virtual IP addressing mechanism

ReadVirtual IPs and Service Proxiesexplains the
mechanism Kubernetes provides to expose a Service with a virtual IP address.

### Traffic policies

You can set the.spec.internalTrafficPolicyand.spec.externalTrafficPolicyfields
to control how Kubernetes routes traffic to healthy (“ready”) backends.

SeeTraffic Policiesfor more details.

### Traffic distribution control

The.spec.trafficDistributionfield provides another way to influence traffic
routing within a Kubernetes Service. While traffic policies focus on strict
semantic guarantees, traffic distribution allows you to expresspreferences(such as routing to topologically closer endpoints). This can help optimize for
performance, cost, or reliability. In Kubernetes 1.35, the
following values are supported:

**PreferSameZone**
  Indicates a preference for routing traffic to endpoints that are in the same
zone as the client.

**PreferSameNode**
  Indicates a preference for routing traffic to endpoints that are on the same
node as the client.

**PreferClose(deprecated)**
  This is an older alias forPreferSameZonethat is less clear about
the semantics.

If the field is not set, the implementation will apply its default routing strategy.

SeeTraffic
Distributionfor
more details

### Session stickiness

If you want to make sure that connections from a particular client are passed to
the same Pod each time, you can configure session affinity based on the client's
IP address. Readsession affinityto learn more.

## External IPs

If there are external IPs that route to one or more cluster nodes, Kubernetes Services
can be exposed on thoseexternalIPs. When network traffic arrives into the cluster, with
the external IP (as destination IP) and the port matching that Service, rules and routes
that Kubernetes has configured ensure that the traffic is routed to one of the endpoints
for that Service.

When you define a Service, you can specifyexternalIPsfor anyservice type.
In the example below, the Service named"my-service"can be accessed by clients using TCP,
on"198.51.100.32:80"(calculated from.spec.externalIPs[]and.spec.ports[].port).

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 49152
  externalIPs:
    - 198.51.100.32
```
