# Chapter 6. Managing image streams

To create and update container images and track version changes in OpenShift Container Platform, you can use image streams and tags. Add, update, remove, and import image stream tags to manage your container images.

## 6.1. Using image streamsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

Image streams provide an abstraction for referencing container images from within OpenShift Container Platform. You can use image streams to manage image versions and automate builds and deployments in your cluster.

Image streams do not contain actual image data, but present a single virtual view of related images, similar to an image repository.

You can configure builds and deployments to watch an image stream for notifications when new images are added and react by performing a build or deployment, respectively.

For example, if a deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that image is created, a deployment could be automatically performed to pick up the new version of the image.

However, if the image stream tag used by the deployment or build is not updated, then even if the container image in the container image registry is updated, the build or deployment continues using the previous, presumably known good image.

The source images can be stored in any of the following:

- OpenShift Container Platform’s integrated registry.
- An external registry, for example registry.redhat.io or quay.io.
- Other image streams in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

When you define an object that references an image stream tag, such as a build or deployment configuration, you point to an image stream tag and not the repository. When you build or deploy your application, OpenShift Container Platform queries the repository using the image stream tag to locate the associated ID of the image and uses that exact image.

The image stream metadata is stored in the etcd instance along with other cluster information.

Using image streams has several significant benefits:

- You can tag, rollback a tag, and quickly deal with images, without having to re-push using the command line.
- You can trigger builds and deployments when a new image is pushed to the registry. Also, OpenShift Container Platform has generic triggers for other resources, such as Kubernetes objects.
- You can mark a tag for periodic re-import. If the source image has changed, that change is picked up and reflected in the image stream, which triggers the build or deployment flow, depending upon the build or deployment configuration.
- You can share images using fine-grained access control and quickly distribute images across your teams.
- If the source image changes, the image stream tag still points to a known-good version of the image, ensuring that your application does not break unexpectedly.
- You can configure security around who can view and use the images through permissions on the image stream objects.
- Users that lack permission to read or list images on the cluster level can still retrieve the images tagged in a project using image streams.

## 6.2. Configuring image streamsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To customize image retrieval and security policies for your applications, configure image streams within OpenShift Container Platform. This process lets you define image pull specifications, manage tags, and control access permissions necessary for reliable application deployment.

AnImageStreamobject file contains the following elements.

where

**name**
  Specifies the name of the image stream

**ruby-sample**
  Specifies the Docker repository path where new images can be pushed to add or update them in this image stream.

**dockerImageReference**
  Specifies the SHA identifier that this image stream tag currently references. Resources that reference this image stream tag use this identifier

**image**
  Specifies the SHA identifier that this image stream tag previously referenced. You can use it to rollback to an older image.

**tag**
  Specifies the image stream tag name.

## 6.3. Image stream imagesCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To precisely identify and manage the actual image content associated with a specific tag, reference and use image stream images in OpenShift Container Platform. This ensures your application deployments reliably target immutable image definitions.

An image stream image points from within an image stream to a particular image ID.

Image stream images allow you to retrieve metadata about an image from a particular image stream where it is tagged.

Image stream image objects are automatically created in OpenShift Container Platform whenever you import or tag an image into the image stream. You should never have to explicitly define an image stream image object in any image stream definition that you use to create image streams.

The image stream image consists of the image stream name and image ID from the repository, delimited by an@sign:

To refer to the image in theImageStreamobject example, the image stream image looks like:

## 6.4. Image stream tagsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To maintain human-readable references to immutable images, utilize image stream tags within OpenShift Container Platform. These tags are essential because they enable your builds and deployments to accurately target specific, stable image content.

An image stream tag is a named pointer to an image in an image stream. It is abbreviated asistag. An image stream tag is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given image stream and tag.

Image stream tags can reference any local or externally managed image. It contains a history of images represented as a stack of all images the tag ever pointed to. Whenever a new or existing image is tagged under particular image stream tag, it is placed at the first position in the history stack. The image previously occupying the top position is available at the second position. This allows for easy rollbacks to make tags point to historical images again.

The following image stream tag is from anImageStreamobject:

Image stream tags can be permanent tags or tracking tags.

- Permanent tags are version-specific tags that point to a particular version of an image, such as Python 3.5.
- Tracking tags are reference tags that follow another image stream tag and can be updated to change which image they follow, like a symlink. These new levels are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible.For example, thelatestimage stream tags that ship with OpenShift Container Platform are tracking tags. This means consumers of thelatestimage stream tag are updated to the newest level of the framework provided by the image when a new level becomes available. Alatestimage stream tag tov3.10can be changed tov3.11at any time. It is important to be aware that theselatestimage stream tags behave differently than the Dockerlatesttag. Thelatestimage stream tag, in this case, does not point to the latest image in the Docker repository. It points to another image stream tag, which might not be the latest version of an image. For example, if thelatestimage stream tag points tov3.10of an image, when the3.11version is released, thelatesttag is not automatically updated tov3.11, and remains atv3.10until it is manually updated to point to av3.11image stream tag.Tracking tags are limited to a single image stream and cannot reference other image streams.

Tracking tags are limited to a single image stream and cannot reference other image streams.

You can create your own image stream tags for your own needs.

The image stream tag is composed of the name of the image stream and a tag, separated by a colon:

For example, to refer to thesha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13dimage in theImageStreamobject example earlier, the image stream tag would be:

## 6.5. Image stream change triggersCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To automate your application lifecycle and ensure they use the latest code, configure image stream triggers in OpenShift Container Platform. Image stream triggers allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an upstream image is available.

For example, builds and deployments can be automatically started when an image stream tag is modified. This is achieved by monitoring that particular image stream tag and notifying the build or deployment when a change is detected.

## 6.6. Image stream mappingCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

Manage how OpenShift Container Platform tracks newly uploaded images by understanding image stream mapping. When the integrated registry receives a new image, it automatically creates and sends an image stream mapping, providing the image’s crucial project, name, tag, and metadata.

Configuring image stream mappings is an advanced feature.

This information is used to create a new image, if it does not already exist, and to tag the image into the image stream. OpenShift Container Platform stores complete metadata about each image, such as commands, entry point, and environment variables. Images in OpenShift Container Platform are immutable and the maximum name length is 63 characters.

The following image stream mapping example results in an image being tagged astest/origin-ruby-sample:latest:

## 6.7. Working with image streamsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To organize and manage container images in OpenShift Container Platform, you can use image streams and image stream tags. By using image streams, you can track image versions and simplify deployments.

Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.

The following default projects are considered highly privileged:default,kube-public,kube-system,openshift,openshift-infra,openshift-node, and other system-created projects that have theopenshift.io/run-levellabel set to0or1. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.

### 6.7.1. Getting information about image streamsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To efficiently manage and monitor your image streams in OpenShift Container Platform, retrieve information about their versions. You can get general information about the image stream and detailed information about all the tags it is pointing to, ensuring your deployed applications rely on the correct image versions.

Procedure

- To get general information about the image stream and detailed information about all the tags it is pointing to, enter the following command:oc describe is/<image-name>$oc describe is/<image-name>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example:oc describe is/python$oc describe is/pythonCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputName:			python

### 6.7.2. Adding tags to an image streamCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To accurately manage and track specific versions of your container images, add tags to your image streams within OpenShift Container Platform, This ensures reliable referencing and deployment throughout your environment.

Procedure

- Add a tag that points to one of the existing tags by using the `oc tag`command:oc tag <image-name:tag1> <image-name:tag2>$oc tag<image-name:tag1><image-name:tag2>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example:oc tag python:3.5 python:latest$oc tag python:3.5 python:latestCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputTag python:latest set to python@sha256:49c18358df82f4577386404991c51a9559f243e0b1bdc366df25.Tag python:latest set to python@sha256:49c18358df82f4577386404991c51a9559f243e0b1bdc366df25.Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

### 6.7.3. Adding tags for an external imageCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To enable OpenShift Container Platform resources to track and consume container images sourced from external registries, add tags to the corresponding image streams. This action integrates external image content securely into your cluster’s local image management system.

Procedure

- Add tags pointing to internal or external images, by using theoc tagcommand for all tag-related operations:oc tag <repository/image> <image-name:tag>$oc tag<repository/image><image-name:tag>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example, this command maps thedocker.io/python:3.6.0image to the3.6tag in thepythonimage stream.oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6$oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputTag python:3.6 set to docker.io/python:3.6.0.Tag python:3.6 set to docker.io/python:3.6.0.Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowIf the external image is secured, you must create a secret with credentials for accessing that registry.

Add tags pointing to internal or external images, by using theoc tagcommand for all tag-related operations:

For example, this command maps thedocker.io/python:3.6.0image to the3.6tag in thepythonimage stream.

Example output

If the external image is secured, you must create a secret with credentials for accessing that registry.

### 6.7.4. Updating image stream tagsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To maintain flexibility and consistency in deployment definitions, update an image stream tag to reflect a different tag in OpenShift Container Platform. Specifically, you can update a tag to reflect another tag in an image stream, which is essential for managing image versions effectively.

Procedure

- Update a tag:oc tag <image-name:tag> <image-name:latest>$oc tag<image-name:tag><image-name:latest>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example, the following updates thelatesttag to reflect the3.6tag in an image stream:oc tag python:3.6 python:latest$oc tag python:3.6 python:latestCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputTag python:latest set to python@sha256:438208801c4806548460b27bd1fbcb7bb188273d13871ab43f.Tag python:latest set to python@sha256:438208801c4806548460b27bd1fbcb7bb188273d13871ab43f.Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Update a tag:

For example, the following updates thelatesttag to reflect the3.6tag in an image stream:

Example output

### 6.7.5. Removing image stream tagsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To maintain control over your image history and simplify management within OpenShift Container Platform, you can remove old tags from an image stream. This action helps ensure that your resources track only the current and necessary image references.

Procedure

- Remove old tags from an image stream:oc tag -d <image-name:tag>$oc tag-d<image-name:tag>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example:oc tag -d python:3.6$oc tag-dpython:3.6Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputDeleted tag default/python:3.6Deleted tag default/python:3.6Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Remove old tags from an image stream:

For example:

Example output

Additional resources

- Removing deprecated image stream tags from the Cluster Samples Operator

### 6.7.6. Configuring periodic importing of image stream tagsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To maintain up-to-date image definitions from an external container image registry, configure periodic importing of image stream tags. This process allows you to quickly re-import images for critical security updates by using the--scheduledflag.

Procedure

- Schedule importing images:oc tag <repository/image> <image-name:tag> --scheduled$oc tag<repository/image><image-name:tag>--scheduledCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowFor example:oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6 --scheduled$oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6--scheduledCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowExample outputTag python:3.6 set to import docker.io/python:3.6.0 periodically.Tag python:3.6 set to import docker.io/python:3.6.0 periodically.Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflowThis command causes OpenShift Container Platform to periodically update this particular image stream tag. This period is a cluster-wide setting set to 15 minutes by default.

Schedule importing images:

For example:

Example output

This command causes OpenShift Container Platform to periodically update this particular image stream tag. This period is a cluster-wide setting set to 15 minutes by default.

- Remove the periodic check, re-run above command but omit the--scheduledflag. This will reset its behavior to default.oc tag <repositiory/image> <image-name:tag>$oc tag<repositiory/image><image-name:tag>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

To bring container images into your OpenShift Container Platform cluster and manage their references, you can import images from external registries and organize them by using image streams. By using this process, you can maintain a centralized registry of container images for your applications.

The following sections describe how to import, and work with, image streams.

### 6.8.1. Importing images and image streams from private registriesCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To securely manage content from external sources, configure your image streams to import tag and image metadata from private registries requiring authentication. This procedure is essential if you change the registry that the Cluster Samples Operator uses for pulling content to something other than the defaultregistry.redhat.io.

When importing from insecure or secure registries, the registry URL defined in the secret must include the:80port suffix or the secret is not used when attempting to import from the registry.

Procedure

- You must create asecretobject that is used to store your credentials by entering the following command:oc create secret generic <secret_name> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<file_absolute_path> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson$oc create secret generic<secret_name>--from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<file_absolute_path>--type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjsonCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

You must create asecretobject that is used to store your credentials by entering the following command:

After the secret is configured, create the new image stream or enter theoc import-imagecommand:

During the import process, OpenShift Container Platform picks up the secrets and provides them to the remote party.

### 6.8.2. Working with manifest listsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To precisely manage multi-architecture or variant images contained within a manifest list, use the--import-modeflag withoc import-imageoroc tagCLI commands. This functionality allows you to import a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, of a manifest list, providing fine-grained control over your image stream content.

In some cases, users might want to use sub-manifests directly. Whenoc adm prune imagesis run, or theCronJobpruner runs, they cannot detect when a sub-manifest list is used. As a result, an administrator usingoc adm prune images, or theCronJobpruner, might delete entire manifest lists, including sub-manifests.

To avoid this limitation, you can use the manifest list by tag or by digest instead.

Procedure

- Create an image stream that includes multi-architecture images, and sets the import mode toPreserveOriginal, by entering the following command:oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \

#### 6.8.2.1. Configuring periodic importing of manifest listsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To maintain up-to-date image references for complex, multi-architecture images, configure periodic importing of manifest lists. To periodically re-import a manifest list, you can use the--scheduledflag, ensuring your image stream tracks the latest versions from external registries.

Procedure

- Set the image stream to periodically update the manifest list by entering the following command:oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --scheduled=true$oc import-image<multiarch-image-stream-tag>--from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name>\--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'--scheduled=trueCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Set the image stream to periodically update the manifest list by entering the following command:

```
oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --scheduled=true
```

```
$ oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --scheduled=true
```

#### 6.8.2.2. Configuring SSL/TLS when importing manifest listsCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To control connection security and access policies for manifest lists sourced from external repositories, configure SSL/TLS settings during image importing. To configure SSL/TLS when importing a manifest list, you can use the--insecureflag to bypass standard certificate validation requirements if necessary.

Procedure

- Set--insecure=trueso that importing a manifest list skips SSL/TLS verification. For example:oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag> --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --insecure=true$oc import-image<multiarch-image-stream-tag>--from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name>\--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'--insecure=trueCopy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Set--insecure=trueso that importing a manifest list skips SSL/TLS verification. For example:

```
oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag> --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --insecure=true
```

```
$ oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag> --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal' --insecure=true
```

### 6.8.3. Specifying architecture for --import-modeCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To control the architecture of your imported images and ensure proper deployment, use the--import-mode=flag. You can swap your imported image stream between multi-architecture and single architecture by excluding or including the--import-mode=flag as needed.

Procedure

- Run the following command to update your image stream from multi-architecture to single architecture by excluding the--import-mode=flag:oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag> --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name>$oc import-image<multiarch-image-stream-tag>--from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name>Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Run the following command to update your image stream from multi-architecture to single architecture by excluding the--import-mode=flag:

- Run the following command to update your image stream from single-architecture to multi-architecture:oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'$oc import-image<multiarch-image-stream-tag>--from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name>\--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'Copy to ClipboardCopied!Toggle word wrapToggle overflow

Run the following command to update your image stream from single-architecture to multi-architecture:

```
oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'
```

```
$ oc import-image <multiarch-image-stream-tag>  --from=<registry>/<project_name>/<image-name> \
--import-mode='PreserveOriginal'
```

### 6.8.4. Configuration fields for --import-modeCopy linkLink copied to clipboard!

To implement multi-architecture image management using the--import-modeflag, reference the necessary configuration fields. These fields define precise parameters for selecting and importing specific manifests into your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

The following table describes the options available for the--import-mode=flag:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Legacy | The default option for--import-mode. When specified, the manifest list is discarded, and a single su |
| PreserveOriginal | When specified, the original manifest is preserved. For manifest lists, the manifest list and all of |

Legacy

The default option for--import-mode. When specified, the manifest list is discarded, and a single sub-manifest is imported. The platform is chosen in the following order of priority:

- Tag annotations
- Control plane architecture
- Linux/AMD64
- The first manifest in the list

PreserveOriginal

When specified, the original manifest is preserved. For manifest lists, the manifest list and all of its sub-manifests are imported.
