# Deployments

ADeploymentprovides declarative updates forPodsandReplicaSets.

You describe adesired statein a Deployment, and the DeploymentControllerchanges the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

#### Note:

## Use Case

The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

- Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
- Declare the new state of the Podsby updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created, and the Deployment gradually scales it up while scaling down the old ReplicaSet, ensuring Pods are replaced at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
- Rollback to an earlier Deployment revisionif the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.
- Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load.
- Pause the rollout of a Deploymentto apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.
- Use the status of the Deploymentas an indicator that a rollout has stuck.
- Clean up older ReplicaSetsthat you don't need anymore.

## Creating a Deployment

The following is an example of a Deployment. It creates a ReplicaSet to bring up threenginxPods:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In this example:

- A Deployment namednginx-deploymentis created, indicated by the.metadata.namefield. This name will become the basis for the ReplicaSets
and Pods which are created later. SeeWriting a Deployment Specfor more details.

A Deployment namednginx-deploymentis created, indicated by the.metadata.namefield. This name will become the basis for the ReplicaSets
and Pods which are created later. SeeWriting a Deployment Specfor more details.

- The Deployment creates a ReplicaSet that creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the.spec.replicasfield.

The Deployment creates a ReplicaSet that creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the.spec.replicasfield.

- The.spec.selectorfield defines how the created ReplicaSet finds which Pods to manage.
In this case, you select a label that is defined in the Pod template (app: nginx).
However, more sophisticated selection rules are possible,
as long as the Pod template itself satisfies the rule.Note:The.spec.selector.matchLabelsfield is a map of {key,value} pairs.
A single {key,value} in thematchLabelsmap is equivalent to an element ofmatchExpressions,
whosekeyfield is "key", theoperatoris "In", and thevaluesarray contains only "value".
All of the requirements, from bothmatchLabelsandmatchExpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.

The.spec.selectorfield defines how the created ReplicaSet finds which Pods to manage.
In this case, you select a label that is defined in the Pod template (app: nginx).
However, more sophisticated selection rules are possible,
as long as the Pod template itself satisfies the rule.

#### Note:

- The.spec.templatefield contains the following sub-fields:The Pods are labeledapp: nginxusing the.metadata.labelsfield.The Pod template's specification, or.specfield, indicates that
the Pods run one container,nginx, which runs thenginxDocker Hubimage at version 1.14.2.Create one container and name itnginxusing the.spec.containers[0].namefield.

The.spec.templatefield contains the following sub-fields:

- The Pods are labeledapp: nginxusing the.metadata.labelsfield.
- The Pod template's specification, or.specfield, indicates that
the Pods run one container,nginx, which runs thenginxDocker Hubimage at version 1.14.2.
- Create one container and name itnginxusing the.spec.containers[0].namefield.

Before you begin, make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
Follow the steps given below to create the above Deployment:

- Create the Deployment by running the following command:kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

Create the Deployment by running the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
```

- Runkubectl get deploymentsto check if the Deployment was created.If the Deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1sWhen you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:NAMElists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.READYdisplays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.UP-TO-DATEdisplays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.AVAILABLEdisplays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.AGEdisplays the amount of time that the application has been running.Notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to.spec.replicasfield.

Runkubectl get deploymentsto check if the Deployment was created.

If the Deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s
```

When you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:

- NAMElists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.
- READYdisplays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.
- UP-TO-DATEdisplays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
- AVAILABLEdisplays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
- AGEdisplays the amount of time that the application has been running.

Notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to.spec.replicasfield.

- To see the Deployment rollout status, runkubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment.The output is similar to:Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

To see the Deployment rollout status, runkubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment.

The output is similar to:

```
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...

```

- Run thekubectl get deploymentsagain a few seconds later.
The output is similar to this:NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18sNotice that the Deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest Pod template) and available.

Run thekubectl get deploymentsagain a few seconds later.
The output is similar to this:

```

nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s
```

ReplicaSet output shows the following fields:

- NAMElists the names of the ReplicaSets in the namespace.
- DESIREDdisplays the desired number ofreplicasof the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is thedesired state.
- CURRENTdisplays how many replicas are currently running.
- READYdisplays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
- AGEdisplays the amount of time that the application has been running.

Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as[DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[HASH]. This name will become the basis for the Pods

```

The created ReplicaSet ensures that there are threenginxPods.

#### Note:

You must specify an appropriate selector and Pod template labels in a Deployment
(in this case,app: nginx).

Do not overlap labels or selectors with other controllers (including other Deployments and StatefulSets). Kubernetes doesn't stop you from overlapping, and if multiple controllers have overlapping selectors those controllers might conflict and behave unexpectedly.

### Pod-template-hash label

#### Caution:

Thepod-template-hashlabel is added by the Deployment controller to every ReplicaSet that a Deployment creates or adopts.

This label ensures that child ReplicaSets of a Deployment do not overlap. It is generated by hashing thePodTemplateof the ReplicaSet and using the resulting hash as the label value that is added to the ReplicaSet selector, Pod template labels,
and in any existing Pods that the ReplicaSet might have.

## Updating a Deployment

#### Note:

Follow the steps given below to update your Deployment:

- Let's update the nginx Pods to use thenginx:1.16.1image instead of thenginx:1.14.2image.kubectlsetimage deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deploymentnginx=nginx:1.16.1or use the following command:kubectlsetimage deployment/nginx-deploymentnginx=nginx:1.16.1wheredeployment/nginx-deploymentindicates the Deployment,nginxindicates the Container the update will take place andnginx:1.16.1indicates the new image and its tag.The output is similar to:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updatedAlternatively, you caneditthe Deployment and change.spec.template.spec.containers[0].imagefromnginx:1.14.2tonginx:1.16.1:kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment edited

Let's update the nginx Pods to use thenginx:1.16.1image instead of thenginx:1.14.2image.

```
kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

or use the following command:

```
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

wheredeployment/nginx-deploymentindicates the Deployment,nginxindicates the Container the update will take place andnginx:1.16.1indicates the new image and its tag.

The output is similar to:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```

Alternatively, you caneditthe Deployment and change.spec.template.spec.containers[0].imagefromnginx:1.14.2tonginx:1.16.1:

```
kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment edited
```

- To see the rollout status, run:kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...ordeployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

To see the rollout status, run:

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
```

or

```
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
```

Get more details on your updated Deployment:

- After the rollout succeeds, you can view the Deployment by runningkubectl get deployments.
The output is similar to this:NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           36s

After the rollout succeeds, you can view the Deployment by runningkubectl get deployments.
The output is similar to this:

```

```

- Runkubectl get rsto see that the Deployment updated the Pods by creating a new ReplicaSet and scaling it
up to 3 replicas, as well as scaling down the old ReplicaSet to 0 replicas.kubectl get rsThe output is similar to this:NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE

Runkubectl get rsto see that the Deployment updated the Pods by creating a new ReplicaSet and scaling it
up to 3 replicas, as well as scaling down the old ReplicaSet to 0 replicas.

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE

nginx-deployment-1564180365-z9gth   1/1       Running   0          14sNext time you want to update these Pods, you only need to update the Deployment's Pod template again.Deployment ensures that only a certain number of Pods are down while they are being updated. By default,
it ensures that at least 75% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max unavailable).Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods.
By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max surge).For example, if you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first creates a new Pod,
then deletes an old Pod, and creates another new one. It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of
new Pods have come up, and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed.
It makes sure that at least 3 Pods are available and that at max 4 Pods in total are available. In case of
a Deployment with 4 replicas, the number of Pods would be between 3 and 5.

Runningget podsshould now show only the new Pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-1564180365-khku8   1/1       Running   0          14s

nginx-deployment-1564180365-z9gth   1/1       Running   0          14s
```

Next time you want to update these Pods, you only need to update the Deployment's Pod template again.

Deployment ensures that only a certain number of Pods are down while they are being updated. By default,
it ensures that at least 75% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max unavailable).

Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods.
By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max surge).

For example, if you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first creates a new Pod,
then deletes an old Pod, and creates another new one. It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of
new Pods have come up, and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed.
It makes sure that at least 3 Pods are available and that at max 4 Pods in total are available. In case of
a Deployment with 4 replicas, the number of Pods would be between 3 and 5.

```

Here you see that when you first created the Deployment, it created a ReplicaSet (nginx-deployment-2035384211)
and scaled it up to 3 replicas directly. When you updated the Deployment, it created a new ReplicaSet
(nginx-deployment-1564180365) and scaled it up to 1 and waited for it to come up. Then it scaled down the old ReplicaSet
to 2 and scaled up the new ReplicaSet to 2 so that at least 3 Pods were available and at most 4 Pods were created at all times.
It then continued scaling up and down the new and the old ReplicaSet, with the same rolling update strategy.
Finally, you'll have 3 available replicas in the new ReplicaSet, and the old ReplicaSet is scaled down to 0.

#### Note:

### Rollover (aka multiple updates in-flight)

Each time a new Deployment is observed by the Deployment controller, a ReplicaSet is created to bring up
the desired Pods. If the Deployment is updated, the existing ReplicaSet that controls Pods whose labels
match.spec.selectorbut whose template does not match.spec.templateis scaled down. Eventually, the new
ReplicaSet is scaled to.spec.replicasand all old ReplicaSets is scaled to 0.

If you update a Deployment while an existing rollout is in progress, the Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet
as per the update and start scaling that up, and rolls over the ReplicaSet that it was scaling up previously
-- it will add it to its list of old ReplicaSets and start scaling it down.

For example, suppose you create a Deployment to create 5 replicas ofnginx:1.14.2,
but then update the Deployment to create 5 replicas ofnginx:1.16.1, when only 3
replicas ofnginx:1.14.2had been created. In that case, the Deployment immediately starts
killing the 3nginx:1.14.2Pods that it had created, and starts creatingnginx:1.16.1Pods. It does not wait for the 5 replicas ofnginx:1.14.2to be created
before changing course.

### Label selector updates

It is generally discouraged to make label selector updates and it is suggested to plan your selectors up front.
A Deployment's label selector isimmutableafter creation;
it cannot be updated viakubectl patch,kubectl edit,kubectl apply, or tools likehelm upgrade.

If you must change the selector, you have to delete the Deployment and recreate it.
Exercise great caution and ensure you grasp the following implications:

- Additions:When you create a new Deployment with a narrower selector, the new Deploymentmustalso have a suitable Pod template.
If you have an existing manifest and you edit the manifest to narrow the selector, you need to edit the metadata of the Pod template inside that Deployment, adding the
new labels
to match, as otherwise the API server returns a validation error. This is anon-overlappingchange:
the new Deployment will not "see" the old Pods (which lack the new label), causing the old
ReplicaSet to beorphanedand a brand-new ReplicaSet to be created.
- Value Updates:Changing the existing value in a selector key (e.g., fromv1tov2)
results in the same behavior as additions (orphaning and recreation).
- Removals:Removing an existing key from the Deployment selector does not require any changes
in the Pod template labels. This is anoverlappingchange: the new, broader selector would
match the old Pods. Existing ReplicaSets are not orphaned, and a new ReplicaSet is not created,
but note that the removed label still exists in any existing Pods and ReplicaSets.
You can clean that up by triggering a rollout for the Deployment.

## Rolling Back a Deployment

Sometimes, you may want to rollback a Deployment; for example, when the Deployment is not stable, such as crash looping.
By default, all of the Deployment's rollout history is kept in the system so that you can rollback anytime you want
(you can change that by modifying revision history limit).

#### Note:

- Suppose that you made a typo while updating the Deployment, by putting the image name asnginx:1.161instead ofnginx:1.16.1:kubectlsetimage deployment/nginx-deploymentnginx=nginx:1.161The output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated

Suppose that you made a typo while updating the Deployment, by putting the image name asnginx:1.161instead ofnginx:1.16.1:

```
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```

- The rollout gets stuck. You can verify it by checking the rollout status:kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...

The rollout gets stuck. You can verify it by checking the rollout status:

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```

```

- Press Ctrl-C to stop the above rollout status watch. For more information on stuck rollouts,read more here.

- You see that the number of old replicas (adding the replica count fromnginx-deployment-1564180365andnginx-deployment-2035384211) is 3, and the number of
new replicas (fromnginx-deployment-3066724191) is 1.kubectl get rsThe output is similar to this:NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE

You see that the number of old replicas (adding the replica count fromnginx-deployment-1564180365andnginx-deployment-2035384211) is 3, and the number of
new replicas (fromnginx-deployment-3066724191) is 1.

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```

```

- Looking at the Pods created, you see that 1 Pod created by new ReplicaSet is stuck in an image pull loop.kubectl get podsThe output is similar to this:NAME                                READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE

nginx-deployment-3066724191-08mng   0/1       ImagePullBackOff   0          6sNote:The Deployment controller stops the bad rollout automatically, and stops scaling up the new ReplicaSet. This depends on the rollingUpdate parameters (maxUnavailablespecifically) that you have specified. Kubernetes by default sets the value to 25%.

Looking at the Pods created, you see that 1 Pod created by new ReplicaSet is stuck in an image pull loop.

```
kubectl get pods
```

The output is similar to this:

```

To fix this, you need to rollback to a previous revision of Deployment that is stable.

### Checking Rollout History of a Deployment

Follow the steps given below to check the rollout history:

- First, check the revisions of this Deployment:kubectl rollouthistorydeployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:deployments "nginx-deployment"
REVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE
1           <none>
2           <none>
3           <none>CHANGE-CAUSEis copied from the Deployment annotationkubernetes.io/change-causeto its revisions upon creation. You can specify theCHANGE-CAUSEmessage by:Annotating the Deployment withkubectl annotate deployment/nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="image updated to 1.16.1"Manually editing the manifest of the resource.Using tooling that sets the annotation automatically.Note:In older versions of Kubernetes, you could use the--recordflag with kubectl commands to automatically populate theCHANGE-CAUSEfield. This flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

First, check the revisions of this Deployment:

```
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployments "nginx-deployment"
REVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE
1           <none>
2           <none>
3           <none>
```

CHANGE-CAUSEis copied from the Deployment annotationkubernetes.io/change-causeto its revisions upon creation. You can specify theCHANGE-CAUSEmessage by:

- Annotating the Deployment withkubectl annotate deployment/nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="image updated to 1.16.1"
- Manually editing the manifest of the resource.
- Using tooling that sets the annotation automatically.

#### Note:

- To see the details of each revision, run:kubectl rollouthistorydeployment/nginx-deployment --revision=2The output is similar to this:deployments "nginx-deployment" revision 2
  Labels:       app=nginx
          pod-template-hash=1159050644
  Containers:
   nginx:

        cpu:      BestEffort
        memory:   BestEffort
    Environment Variables:      <none>
  No volumes.

To see the details of each revision, run:

```
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment --revision=2
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployments "nginx-deployment" revision 2
  Labels:       app=nginx
          pod-template-hash=1159050644

        memory:   BestEffort
    Environment Variables:      <none>
  No volumes.
```

### Rolling Back to a Previous Revision

Follow the steps given below to rollback the Deployment from the current version to the previous version, which is version 2.

- Now you've decided to undo the current rollout and rollback to the previous revision:kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled backAlternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with--to-revision:kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2The output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled backFor more details about rollout related commands, readkubectl rollout.The Deployment is now rolled back to a previous stable revision. As you can see, aDeploymentRollbackevent
for rolling back to revision 2 is generated from Deployment controller.

Now you've decided to undo the current rollout and rollback to the previous revision:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back
```

Alternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with--to-revision:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back
```

For more details about rollout related commands, readkubectl rollout.

The Deployment is now rolled back to a previous stable revision. As you can see, aDeploymentRollbackevent
for rolling back to revision 2 is generated from Deployment controller.

- Check if the rollback was successful and the Deployment is running as expected, run:kubectl get deployment nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           30m

Check if the rollback was successful and the Deployment is running as expected, run:

```
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```

## Scaling a Deployment

You can scale a Deployment by using the following command:

```
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

Assuminghorizontal Pod autoscalingis enabled
in your cluster, you can set up an autoscaler for your Deployment and choose the minimum and maximum number of
Pods you want to run based on the CPU utilization of your existing Pods.

```
kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80
```

The output is similar to this:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

### Proportional scaling

RollingUpdate Deployments support running multiple versions of an application at the same time. When you
or an autoscaler scales a RollingUpdate Deployment that is in the middle of a rollout (either in progress
or paused), the Deployment controller balances the additional replicas in the existing active
ReplicaSets (ReplicaSets with Pods) in order to mitigate risk. This is calledproportional scaling.

For example, you are running a Deployment with 10 replicas,maxSurge=3, andmaxUnavailable=2.

- Ensure that the 10 replicas in your Deployment are running.kubectl get deployThe output is similar to this:NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment     10        10        10           10          50s

Ensure that the 10 replicas in your Deployment are running.

```
kubectl get deploy
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment     10        10        10           10          50s
```

- You update to a new image which happens to be unresolvable from inside the cluster.kubectlsetimage deployment/nginx-deploymentnginx=nginx:sometagThe output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated

You update to a new image which happens to be unresolvable from inside the cluster.

```
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:sometag
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```

- The image update starts a new rollout with ReplicaSet nginx-deployment-1989198191, but it's blocked due to themaxUnavailablerequirement that you mentioned above. Check out the rollout status:kubectl get rsThe output is similar to this:NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-deployment-1989198191   5         5         0         9s
nginx-deployment-618515232    8         8         8         1m

The image update starts a new rollout with ReplicaSet nginx-deployment-1989198191, but it's blocked due to themaxUnavailablerequirement that you mentioned above. Check out the rollout status:

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-deployment-1989198191   5         5         0         9s
nginx-deployment-618515232    8         8         8         1m
```

- Then a new scaling request for the Deployment comes along. The autoscaler increments the Deployment replicas
to 15. The Deployment controller needs to decide where to add these new 5 replicas. If you weren't using
proportional scaling, all 5 of them would be added in the new ReplicaSet. With proportional scaling, you
spread the additional replicas across all ReplicaSets. Bigger proportions go to the ReplicaSets with the
most replicas and lower proportions go to ReplicaSets with less replicas. Any leftovers are added to the
ReplicaSet with the most replicas. ReplicaSets with zero replicas are not scaled up.

Then a new scaling request for the Deployment comes along. The autoscaler increments the Deployment replicas
to 15. The Deployment controller needs to decide where to add these new 5 replicas. If you weren't using

spread the additional replicas across all ReplicaSets. Bigger proportions go to the ReplicaSets with the
most replicas and lower proportions go to ReplicaSets with less replicas. Any leftovers are added to the
ReplicaSet with the most replicas. ReplicaSets with zero replicas are not scaled up.

In our example above, 3 replicas are added to the old ReplicaSet and 2 replicas are added to the
new ReplicaSet. The rollout process should eventually move all replicas to the new ReplicaSet, assuming
the new replicas become healthy. To confirm this, run:

```
kubectl get deploy
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment     15        18        7            8           7m
```

The rollout status confirms how the replicas were added to each ReplicaSet.

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-deployment-1989198191   7         7         0         7m
nginx-deployment-618515232    11        11        11        7m
```

## Pausing and Resuming a rollout of a Deployment

When you update a Deployment, or plan to, you can pause rollouts
for that Deployment before you trigger one or more updates. When
you're ready to apply those changes, you resume rollouts for the
Deployment. This approach allows you to
apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.

- For example, with a Deployment that was created:Get the Deployment details:kubectl get deployThe output is similar to this:NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx     3         3         3            3           1mGet the rollout status:kubectl get rsThe output is similar to this:NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m

For example, with a Deployment that was created:

Get the Deployment details:

```
kubectl get deploy
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx     3         3         3            3           1m
```

Get the rollout status:

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m
```

- Pause by running the following command:kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused

Pause by running the following command:

```
kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
```

- Then update the image of the Deployment:kubectlsetimage deployment/nginx-deploymentnginx=nginx:1.16.1The output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated

Then update the image of the Deployment:

```
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```

- Notice that no new rollout started:kubectl rollouthistorydeployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:deployments "nginx"
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1   <none>

Notice that no new rollout started:

```
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployments "nginx"
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1   <none>
```

- Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:kubectl get rsThe output is similar to this:NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m

Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:

```
kubectl get rs
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m
```

- You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:kubectlsetresources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512MiThe output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updatedThe initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to
the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.

You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:

```
kubectl set resources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated
```

The initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to
the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.

- Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deploymentThe output is similar to this:deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed

Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:

```
kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
```

- Watchthe status of the rollout until it's done.kubectl get rs --watchThe output is similar to this:NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE

Watchthe status of the rollout until it's done.

```
kubectl get rs --watch

#### Note:

## Deployment status

A Deployment enters various states during its lifecycle. It can beprogressingwhile
rolling out a new ReplicaSet, it can becomplete, or it canfail to progress.

### Progressing Deployment

Kubernetes marks a Deployment asprogressingwhen one of the following tasks is performed:

- The Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet.
- The Deployment is scaling up its newest ReplicaSet.
- The Deployment is scaling down its older ReplicaSet(s).
- New Pods become ready or available (ready for at leastMinReadySeconds).

When the rollout becomes “progressing”, the Deployment controller adds a condition with the following
attributes to the Deployment's.status.conditions:

- type: Progressing
- status: "True"
- reason: NewReplicaSetCreated|reason: FoundNewReplicaSet|reason: ReplicaSetUpdated

You can monitor the progress for a Deployment by usingkubectl rollout status.

### Complete Deployment

Kubernetes marks a Deployment ascompletewhen it has the following characteristics:

- All of the replicas associated with the Deployment have been updated to the latest version you've specified, meaning any
updates you've requested have been completed.
- All of the replicas associated with the Deployment are available.
- No old replicas for the Deployment are running.

When the rollout becomes “complete”, the Deployment controller sets a condition with the following
attributes to the Deployment's.status.conditions:

- type: Progressing
- status: "True"
- reason: NewReplicaSetAvailable

ThisProgressingcondition will retain a status value of"True"until a new rollout
is initiated. The condition holds even when availability of replicas changes (which
does instead affect theAvailablecondition).

You can check if a Deployment has completed by usingkubectl rollout status. If the rollout completed
successfully,kubectl rollout statusreturns a zero exit code.

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
```

and the exit status fromkubectl rolloutis 0 (success):

```
echo $?
```

```
0
```

### Failed Deployment

Your Deployment may get stuck trying to deploy its newest ReplicaSet without ever completing. This can occur
due to some of the following factors:

- Insufficient quota
- Readiness probe failures
- Image pull errors
- Insufficient permissions
- Limit ranges
- Application runtime misconfiguration

One way you can detect this condition is to specify a deadline parameter in your Deployment spec:
(.spec.progressDeadlineSeconds)..spec.progressDeadlineSecondsdenotes the
number of seconds the Deployment controller waits before indicating (in the Deployment status) that the
Deployment progress has stalled.

The followingkubectlcommand sets the spec withprogressDeadlineSecondsto make the controller report
lack of progress of a rollout for a Deployment after 10 minutes:

```
kubectl patch deployment/nginx-deployment -p '{"spec":{"progressDeadlineSeconds":600}}'
```

The output is similar to this:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment patched
```

Once the deadline has been exceeded, the Deployment controller adds a DeploymentCondition with the following
attributes to the Deployment's.status.conditions:

- type: Progressing
- status: "False"
- reason: ProgressDeadlineExceeded

This condition can also fail early and is then set to status value of"False"due to reasons asReplicaSetCreateError.
Also, the deadline is not taken into account anymore once the Deployment rollout completes.

See theKubernetes API conventionsfor more information on status conditions.

#### Note:

#### Note:

You may experience transient errors with your Deployments, either due to a low timeout that you have set or
due to any other kind of error that can be treated as transient. For example, let's suppose you have
insufficient quota. If you describe the Deployment you will notice the following section:

```
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
<...>
Conditions:
  Type            Status  Reason
  ----            ------  ------
  Available       True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing     True    ReplicaSetUpdated
  ReplicaFailure  True    FailedCreate
<...>
```

If you runkubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml, the Deployment status is similar to this:

```
status:
  availableReplicas: 2
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    message: Replica set "nginx-deployment-4262182780" is progressing.
    reason: ReplicaSetUpdated
    status: "True"
    type: Progressing
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:42Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:42Z
    message: Deployment has minimum availability.
    reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    message: 'Error creating: pods "nginx-deployment-4262182780-" is forbidden: exceeded quota:
      object-counts, requested: pods=1, used: pods=3, limited: pods=2'
    reason: FailedCreate
    status: "True"
    type: ReplicaFailure
  observedGeneration: 3
  replicas: 2
  unavailableReplicas: 2
```

Eventually, once the Deployment progress deadline is exceeded, Kubernetes updates the status and the
reason for the Progressing condition:

```
Conditions:
  Type            Status  Reason
  ----            ------  ------
  Available       True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing     False   ProgressDeadlineExceeded
  ReplicaFailure  True    FailedCreate
```

You can address an issue of insufficient quota by scaling down your Deployment, by scaling down other
controllers you may be running, or by increasing quota in your namespace. If you satisfy the quota
conditions and the Deployment controller then completes the Deployment rollout, you'll see the
Deployment's status update with a successful condition (status: "True"andreason: NewReplicaSetAvailable).

```
Conditions:
  Type          Status  Reason
  ----          ------  ------
  Available     True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing   True    NewReplicaSetAvailable
```

type: Availablewithstatus: "True"means that your Deployment has minimum availability. Minimum availability is dictated
by the parameters specified in the deployment strategy.type: Progressingwithstatus: "True"means that your Deployment
is either in the middle of a rollout and it is progressing or that it has successfully completed its progress and the minimum
required new replicas are available (see the Reason of the condition for the particulars - in our casereason: NewReplicaSetAvailablemeans that the Deployment is complete).

You can check if a Deployment has failed to progress by usingkubectl rollout status.kubectl rollout statusreturns a non-zero exit code if the Deployment has exceeded the progression deadline.

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The output is similar to this:

```
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
error: deployment "nginx" exceeded its progress deadline
```

and the exit status fromkubectl rolloutis 1 (indicating an error):

```
echo $?
```

```
1
```

### Operating on a failed deployment

All actions that apply to a complete Deployment also apply to a failed Deployment. You can scale it up/down, roll back
to a previous revision, or even pause it if you need to apply multiple tweaks in the Deployment Pod template.

## Clean up Policy

You can set.spec.revisionHistoryLimitfield in a Deployment to specify how many old ReplicaSets for
this Deployment you want to retain. The rest will be garbage-collected in the background. By default,
it is 10.

#### Note:

The cleanup only startsaftera Deployment reaches acomplete state.
If you set.spec.revisionHistoryLimitto 0, any rollout nonetheless triggers creation of a new
ReplicaSet before Kubernetes removes the old one.

Even with a non-zero revision history limit, you can have more ReplicaSets than the limit
you configure. For example, if pods are crash looping, and there are multiple rolling updates
events triggered over time, you might end up with more ReplicaSets than the.spec.revisionHistoryLimitbecause the Deployment never reaches a complete state.

## Canary Deployment

If you want to roll out releases to a subset of users or servers using the Deployment, you
can create multiple Deployments, one for each release, following the canary pattern described inmanaging resources.

## Writing a Deployment Spec

As with all other Kubernetes configs, a Deployment needs.apiVersion,.kind, and.metadatafields.
For general information about working with config files, seedeploying applications,
configuring containers, andusing kubectl to manage resourcesdocuments.

When the control plane creates new Pods for a Deployment, the.metadata.nameof the
Deployment is part of the basis for naming those Pods. The name of a Deployment must be a validDNS subdomainvalue, but this can produce unexpected results for the Pod hostnames. For best compatibility,
the name should follow the more restrictive rules for aDNS label.

A Deployment also needs a.specsection.

### Pod Template

The.spec.templateand.spec.selectorare the only required fields of the.spec.

The.spec.templateis aPod template. It has exactly the same schema as aPod, except it is nested and does not have anapiVersionorkind.

In addition to required fields for a Pod, a Pod template in a Deployment must specify appropriate
labels and an appropriate restart policy. For labels, make sure not to overlap with other controllers. Seeselector.

Only a.spec.template.spec.restartPolicyequal toAlwaysis
allowed, which is the default if not specified.

### Replicas

.spec.replicasis an optional field that specifies the number of desired Pods. It defaults to 1.

Should you manually scale a Deployment, example viakubectl scale deployment deployment --replicas=X, and then you update that Deployment based on a manifest
(for example: by runningkubectl apply -f deployment.yaml),
then applying that manifest overwrites the manual scaling that you previously did.

If aHorizontalPodAutoscaler(or any
similar API for horizontal scaling) is managing scaling for a Deployment, don't set.spec.replicas.

Instead, allow the Kubernetescontrol planeto manage the.spec.replicasfield automatically.

### Selector

.spec.selectoris a required field that specifies alabel selectorfor the Pods targeted by this Deployment.

.spec.selectormust match.spec.template.metadata.labels, or it will be rejected by the API.

In API versionapps/v1,.spec.selectorand.metadata.labelsdo not default to.spec.template.metadata.labelsif not set. So they must be set explicitly. Also note that.spec.selectoris immutable after creation of the Deployment inapps/v1.

A Deployment may terminate Pods whose labels match the selector if their template is different
from.spec.templateor if the total number of such Pods exceeds.spec.replicas. It brings up new
Pods with.spec.templateif the number of Pods is less than the desired number.

#### Note:

If you have multiple controllers that have overlapping selectors, the controllers will fight with each
other and won't behave correctly.

### Strategy

.spec.strategyspecifies the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones..spec.strategy.typecan be "Recreate" or "RollingUpdate". "RollingUpdate" is
the default value.

#### Recreate Deployment

All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created when.spec.strategy.type==Recreate.

#### Note:

#### Rolling Update Deployment

The Deployment updates Pods in a rolling update
fashion (gradually scale down the old ReplicaSets and scale up the new one) when.spec.strategy.type==RollingUpdate. You can specifymaxUnavailableandmaxSurgeto control
the rolling update process.

##### Max Unavailable

.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailableis an optional field that specifies the maximum number
of Pods that can be unavailable during the update process. The value can be an absolute number (for example, 5)
or a percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%). The absolute number is calculated from percentage by
rounding down. The value cannot be 0 if.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurgeis 0. The default value is 25%.

For example, when this value is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired
Pods immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new Pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled
down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of Pods available
at all times during the update is at least 70% of the desired Pods.

##### Max Surge

.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurgeis an optional field that specifies the maximum number of Pods
that can be created over the desired number of Pods. The value can be an absolute number (for example, 5) or a
percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%). The value cannot be 0 ifmaxUnavailableis 0. The absolute number
is calculated from the percentage by rounding up. The default value is 25%.

For example, when this value is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when the
rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new Pods does not exceed 130% of desired
Pods. Once old Pods have been killed, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that the
total number of Pods running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired Pods.

Here are some Rolling Update Deployment examples that use themaxUnavailableandmaxSurge:

### Progress Deadline Seconds

.spec.progressDeadlineSecondsis an optional field that specifies the number of seconds you want
to wait for your Deployment to progress before the system reports back that the Deployment hasfailed progressing- surfaced as a condition withtype: Progressing,status: "False".
andreason: ProgressDeadlineExceededin the status of the resource. The Deployment controller will keep
retrying the Deployment. This defaults to 600. In the future, once automatic rollback will be implemented, the Deployment
controller will roll back a Deployment as soon as it observes such a condition.

If specified, this field needs to be greater than.spec.minReadySeconds.

### Min Ready Seconds

.spec.minReadySecondsis an optional field that specifies the minimum number of seconds for which a newly
created Pod should be ready without any of its containers crashing, for it to be considered available.
This defaults to 0 (the Pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready). To learn more about when
a Pod is considered ready, seeContainer Probes.

### Terminating Pods

You can see the terminating pods only if theDeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicasfeature gateis enabled
on theAPI serverand on thekube-controller-manager

Pods that become terminating due to deletion or scale down may take a long time to terminate, and may consume
additional resources during that period. As a result, the total number of all pods can temporarily exceed.spec.replicas. Terminating pods can be tracked using the.status.terminatingReplicasfield of the Deployment.

### Revision History Limit

A Deployment's revision history is stored in the ReplicaSets it controls.

.spec.revisionHistoryLimitis an optional field that specifies the number of old ReplicaSets to retain
to allow rollback. These old ReplicaSets consume resources inetcdand crowd the output ofkubectl get rs. The configuration of each Deployment revision is stored in its ReplicaSets; therefore, once an old ReplicaSet is deleted, you lose the ability to rollback to that revision of Deployment. By default, 10 old ReplicaSets will be kept, however its ideal value depends on the frequency and stability of new Deployments.

More specifically, setting this field to zero means that all old ReplicaSets with 0 replicas will be cleaned up.
In this case, a new Deployment rollout cannot be undone, since its revision history is cleaned up.

### Paused

.spec.pausedis an optional boolean field for pausing and resuming a Deployment. The only difference between
a paused Deployment and one that is not paused, is that any changes into the PodTemplateSpec of the paused
Deployment will not trigger new rollouts as long as it is paused. A Deployment is not paused by default when
it is created.
